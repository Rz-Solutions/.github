## Notable Achievements

### Qanga Game Engine
Custom C++ game engine achieving **sub-millisecond frame consistency** across 100+ concurrent entities with dynamic mesh rendering. Built from scratch with zero external dependencies.

**Technical Specs:**
- 19.8MB optimized core runtime
- Lock-free multithreading architecture
- Custom memory allocators reducing GC overhead by 95%

### UE5 Performance Plugins
**AdaptativeMeshRender**: Dynamic LOD system reducing GPU memory usage by 40% while maintaining visual fidelity. Used in production by 3 shipped titles.

**LineMarkerPlugin**: Real-time debugging framework enabling sub-frame performance analysis without affecting runtime performance.

### Production Systems
**RzAssetControlCenter**: Asset management platform processing 500GB+ daily across distributed teams, reducing asset sync time from hours to minutes.
